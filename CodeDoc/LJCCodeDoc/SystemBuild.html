    <p><b><u>System Build Commands</u></b></p>
    <p>
      The System Build commands are in the LJCProjects folder.
    </p>
    <p><b>BuildAll Command</b></p>
    <p>
      The BuildAll command "BuildAll.cmd" builds all the system Solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The BuildAll command calls each SolutionBuild command.
    </p>
    <p><b>ClearBuild Command</b></p>
    <p>
      The ClearBuild command "ClearBuild.cmd" clears all the system Projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ClearBuild command calls each SolutionClear command file to remove the
      compiled and generated code.<br />This makes the Solutions ready to be
      backed up.
    </p>
    <p><b>UpdateAll Command</b></p>
    <p>
      The UpdateAll command "UpdateAll.cmd" updates all the system Projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The UpdateAll command calls each SolutionUpdate command file to copy the
      Referenced and Runtime dependencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
      <b><u>Solution Commands</u></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Solution commands are in each solution folder.
    </p>
    <p><b>SolutionBuild Command</b></p>
    <p>
      Each Solution has a unique SolutionBuild command.<br />
      The SolutionBuild command name starts with "Build" and is followed with a
      Solution name.<br />
      This is useful if you want to build only that Solution without starting
      Visual Studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      The SolutionBuild command calls the SolutionUpdate command file before
      building the Solution.
    </p>
    <p><b>SolutionUpdate Command</b></p>
    <p>
      Each Solution has a unique SolutionUpdate command.<br />
      The SolutionUpdate command name starts with "Update" and is followed with
      a Solution name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The SolutionUpdate command copies the Referenced and Runtime dependencies
      for the Solution Projects.
    </p>
    <p><b>SolutionClear Command</b></p>
    <p>
      Each Solution has a unique SolutionClear command.<br />
      The SolutionClear command name starts with "Clear" and is followed with a
      Solution name.<br />
      This is useful if you want to clear only that Solutions Projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The SolutionClear command file removes the compiled and generated code.<br />
      This makes the Solution Projects ready to be backed up.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
      <b><u>System Build Procedure</u></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The SolutionUpdate command copies the Referenced dependencies to the Solution
      "External" folder.<br />
      It copies the Runtime dependencies to the projects bin/Debug folder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Referencing dependencies in the External folder allows the developer to
      create and test changes in the current Solution without being affected
      by changes in the dependencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The developer can run the SolutionUpdate command when they are ready to
      incorporate<br /> the potentially changed Referenced and Runtime dependencies.
